# Sara Kay DALI Data Challenge 22W
## Part 1

Given that the data set has global representation, I wanted to use some sort of map visual to convey the global nature of the data. The most informative metric to me seemed to be the income inequality as noted in the gini_reported score. In my first visual, I wanted to show the changes of income inequality over time, since the higher the gini index is, the greater the inequality is. I filtered the data and decided to compare the gini index of countries in the 1980s and 2000s to see how inequality has changed over time.

I wanted to compare the countries with the most amount of data (United States, Canada) and see their population growth.

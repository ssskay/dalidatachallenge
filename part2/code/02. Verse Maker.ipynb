Deliverance belongs to the Lord Answer me when I call O God of my right! How long you people shall my honor suffer shame? But know that the Lord has set apart the faithful for himself When you are disturbed do not sin Offer right sacrifices there are many who say “O that we might see some good! You have put gladness in my heart I will both lie down and sleep in peace Give ear to my words O Lord Listen to the sound of my cry O Lord in the morning you hear my voice For you are not a God who delights in wickedness the boastful will not stand before your eyes You destroy those who speak lies But I through the abundance of your steadfast love Lead me O Lord in your righteousness For there is no truth in their mouths Make them bear their guilt O God But let all who take refuge in you rejoice For you bless the righteous O Lord O Lord do not rebuke me in your anger Be gracious to me O Lord for I am languishing My soul also is struck with terror turn O Lord save my life For in death there is no remembrance of you I am weary with my moaning My eyes waste away because of grief Depart from me all you workers of evil the Lord has heard my supplication All my enemies shall be ashamed and struck with terror O Lord my God in you I take refuge or like a lion they will tear me apart O Lord my God if I have done this if I have repaid my ally with harm then let the enemy pursue and overtake me Rise up O Lord in your anger Let the assembly of the peoples be gathered around you the Lord judges the peoples O let the evil of the wicked come to an end God is my shield God is a righteous judge If one does not repent God will whet his sword he has prepared his deadly weapons See how they conceive evil they make a pit digging it out their mischief returns upon their own heads I will give to the Lord the thanks due to his righteousness O Lord our Sovereign Out of the mouths of babes and infants When I look at your heavens the work of your fingers what are human beings that you are mindful of them Yet you have made them a little lower than God You have given them dominion over the works of your hands all sheep and oxen the birds of the air and the fish of the sea O Lord our Sovereign I will give thanks to the Lord with my whole heart I will be glad and exult in you When my enemies turned back For you have maintained my just cause You have rebuked the nations you have destroyed the wicked the enemies have vanished in everlasting ruins But the Lord sits enthroned forever He judges the world with righteousness the Lord is a stronghold for the oppressed And those who know your name put their trust in you Sing praises to the Lord who dwells in Zion. For he who avenges blood is mindful of them Be gracious to me O Lord. so that I may recount all your praises the nations have sunk in the pit that they made the Lord has made himself known he has executed judgment the wicked shall depart to Sheol For the needy shall not always be forgotten Rise up O Lord! Do not let mortals prevail Put them in fear O Lord Why O Lord do you stand far off? In arrogance the wicked persecute the poor— For the wicked boast of the desires of their heart In the pride of their countenance the wicked say “God will not seek it out” their ways prosper at all times they think in their heart “We shall not be moved their mouths are filled with cursing and deceit and oppression they sit in ambush in the villages they lurk in secret like a lion in its covert they stoop they crouch they think in their heart “God has forgotten Rise up O Lord O God lift up your hand Why do the wicked renounce God But you do see! Indeed you note trouble and grief Break the arm of the wicked and evildoers the Lord is king forever and ever O Lord you will hear the desire of the meek to do justice for the orphan and the oppressed In the Lord I take refuge how can you say to me for look the wicked bend the bow If the foundations are destroyed the Lord is in his holy temple the Lord tests the righteous and the wicked On the wicked he will rain coals of fire and sulfur For the Lord is righteous Help O Lord for there is no longer anyone who is godly they utter lies to each other May the Lord cut off all flattering lips those who say “With our tongues we will prevail “Because the poor are despoiled because the needy groan the promises of the Lord are promises that are pure You O Lord will protect us On every side the wicked prowl How long O Lord? Will you forget me forever? How long must I bear pain in my soul Consider and answer me O Lord my God! and my enemy will say “I have prevailed” But I trusted in your steadfast love I will sing to the Lord Fools say in their hearts “there is no God.” the Lord looks down from heaven on humankind they have all gone astray they are all alike perverse Have they no knowledge all the evildoers there they shall be in great terror You would confound the plans of the poor O that deliverance for Israel would come from Zion! O Lord who may abide in your tent? those who walk blamelessly and do what is right who do not slander with their tongue in whose eyes the wicked are despised who do not lend money at interest Protect me O God for in you I take refuge. I say to the Lord “You are my Lord As for the holy ones in the land they are the noble those who choose another god multiply their sorrows the Lord is my chosen portion and my cup the boundary lines have fallen for me in pleasant places I bless the Lord who gives me counsel I keep the Lord always before me therefore my heart is glad and my soul rejoices For you do not give me up to Sheol You show me the path of life. Hear a just cause O Lord attend to my cry From you let my vindication come If you try my heart if you visit me by night As for what others do by the word of your lips My steps have held fast to your paths I call upon you for you will answer me O God Wondrously show your steadfast love Guard me as the apple of the eye from the wicked who despoil me they close their hearts to pity they track me down now they surround me they are like a lion eager to tear Rise up O Lord confront them overthrow them! from mortals—by your hand O Lord— As for me I shall behold your face in righteousness I love you O Lord my strength. the Lord is my rock my fortress and my deliverer I call upon the Lord who is worthy to be praised the cords of death encompassed me the cords of Sheol entangled me In my distress I called upon the Lord then the earth reeled and rocked Smoke went up from his nostrils He bowed the heavens and came down He rode on a cherub and flew He made darkness his covering around him Out of the brightness before him the Lord also thundered in the heavens And he sent out his arrows and scattered them then the channels of the sea were seen He reached down from on high he took me He delivered me from my strong enemy they confronted me in the day of my calamity He brought me out into a broad place the Lord rewarded me according to my righteousness For I have kept the ways of the Lord For all his ordinances were before me I was blameless before him therefore the Lord has recompensed me according to my righteousness With the loyal you show yourself loyal with the pure you show yourself pure For you deliver a humble people It is you who light my lamp By you I can crush a troop this God—his way is perfect For who is God except the Lord? the God who girded me with strength He made my feet like the feet of a deer He trains my hands for war You have given me the shield of your salvation You gave me a wide place for my steps under me I pursued my enemies and overtook them I struck them down so that they were not able to rise For you girded me with strength for the battle You made my enemies turn their backs to me they cried for help but there was no one to save them I beat them fine like dust before the wind You delivered me from strife with the peoples As soon as they heard of me they obeyed me Foreigners lost heart the Lord lives! Blessed be my rock the God who gave me vengeance who delivered me from my enemies For this I will extol you O Lord among the nations Great triumphs he gives to his king the heavens are telling the glory of God Day to day pours forth speech there is no speech nor are there words yet their voice goes out through all the earth which comes out like a bridegroom from his wedding canopy Its rising is from the end of the heavens the law of the Lord is perfect the precepts of the Lord are right the fear of the Lord is pure More to be desired are they than gold Moreover by them is your servant warned But who can detect their errors? Keep back your servant also from the insolent Let the words of my mouth and the meditation of my heart the Lord answer you in the day of trouble! May he send you help from the sanctuary May he remember all your offerings May he grant you your heart’s desire May we shout for joy over your victory Now I know that the Lord will help his anointed Some take pride in chariots and some in horses they will collapse and fall Give victory to the king O Lord In your strength the king rejoices O Lord You have given him his heart’s desire For you meet him with rich blessings He asked you for life you gave it to him— His glory is great through your help You bestow on him blessings forever For the king trusts in the Lord Your hand will find out all your enemies You will make them like a fiery furnace You will destroy their offspring from the earth If they plan evil against you For you will put them to flight Be exalted O Lord in your strength! My God my God why have you forsaken me? O my God I cry by day but you do not answer Yet you are holy In you our ancestors trusted to you they cried and were saved But I am a worm and not human All who see me mock at me “Commit your cause to the Lord let him deliver— Yet it was you who took me from the womb On you I was cast from my birth Do not be far from me Many bulls encircle me they open wide their mouths at me I am poured out like water my mouth is dried up like a potsherd For dogs are all around me I can count all my bones. they divide my clothes among themselves But you O Lord do not be far away! Deliver my soul from the sword Save me from the mouth of the lion! I will tell of your name to my brothers and sisters You who fear the Lord praise him! For he did not despise or abhor From you comes my praise in the great congregation the poor shall eat and be satisfied All the ends of the earth shall remember For dominion belongs to the Lord to him indeed shall all who sleep in the earth bow down Posterity will serve him and proclaim his deliverance to a people yet unborn the Lord is my shepherd I shall not want. He makes me lie down in green pastures he restores my soul. Even though I walk through the darkest valley You prepare a table before me Surely goodness and mercy shall follow me the earth is the Lord’s and all that is in it for he has founded it on the seas Who shall ascend the hill of the Lord? those who have clean hands and pure hearts they will receive blessing from the Lord Such is the company of those who seek him Lift up your heads O gates! Who is the King of glory? Lift up your heads O gates! Who is this King of glory? to you O Lord I lift up my soul. O my God in you I trust Do not let those who wait for you be put to shame Make me to know your ways O Lord Lead me in your truth and teach me Be mindful of your mercy O Lord and of your steadfast love Do not remember the sins of my youth or my transgressions Good and upright is the Lord He leads the humble in what is right All the paths of the Lord are steadfast love and faithfulness For your name’s sake O Lord Who are they that fear the Lord? they will abide in prosperity the friendship of the Lord is for those who fear him My eyes are ever toward the Lord turn to me and be gracious to me Relieve the troubles of my heart Consider my affliction and my trouble Consider how many are my foes O guard my life and deliver me May integrity and uprightness preserve me Redeem Israel O God Vindicate me O Lord Prove me O Lord and try me For your steadfast love is before my eyes I do not sit with the worthless I hate the company of evildoers I wash my hands in innocence singing aloud a song of thanksgiving O Lord I love the house in which you dwell Do not sweep me away with sinners those in whose hands are evil devices But as for me I walk in my integrity My foot stands on level ground the Lord is my light and my salvation When evildoers assail me though an army encamp against me One thing I asked of the Lord For he will hide me in his shelter Now my head is lifted up Hear O Lord when I cry aloud “Come” my heart says “seek his face!” Do not hide your face from me. If my father and mother forsake me teach me your way O Lord Do not give me up to the will of my adversaries I believe that I shall see the goodness of the Lord Wait for the Lord to you O Lord I call Hear the voice of my supplication Do not drag me away with the wicked Repay them according to their work Because they do not regard the works of the Lord Blessed be the Lord the Lord is my strength and my shield the Lord is the strength of his people O save your people and bless your heritage Ascribe to the Lord O heavenly beings Ascribe to the Lord the glory of his name the voice of the Lord is over the waters the voice of the Lord is powerful the voice of the Lord breaks the cedars He makes Lebanon skip like a calf the voice of the Lord flashes forth flames of fire. the voice of the Lord shakes the wilderness the voice of the Lord causes the oaks to whirl the Lord sits enthroned over the flood May the Lord give strength to his people! I will extol you O Lord for you have drawn me up O Lord my God I cried to you for help O Lord you brought up my soul from Sheol Sing praises to the Lord O you his faithful ones For his anger is but for a moment As for me I said in my prosperity By your favor O Lord to you O Lord I cried “What profit is there in my death Hear O Lord and be gracious to me! You have turned my mourning into dancing so that my soul may praise you and not be silent. In you O Lord I seek refuge Incline your ear to me You are indeed my rock and my fortress take me out of the net that is hidden for me Into your hand I commit my spirit You hate those who pay regard to worthless idols I will exult and rejoice in your steadfast love and have not delivered me into the hand of the enemy Be gracious to me O Lord for I am in distress For my life is spent with sorrow I am the scorn of all my adversaries I have passed out of mind like one who is dead For I hear the whispering of many— But I trust in you O Lord My times are in your hand Let your face shine upon your servant Do not let me be put to shame O Lord Let the lying lips be stilled O how abundant is your goodness In the shelter of your presence you hide them Blessed be the Lord I had said in my alarm Love the Lord all you his saints. Be strong and let your heart take courage Happy are those whose transgression is forgiven Happy are those to whom the Lord imputes no iniquity While I kept silence my body wasted away For day and night your hand was heavy upon me then I acknowledged my sin to you therefore let all who are faithful You are a hiding place for me I will instruct you and teach you the way you should go Do not be like a horse or a mule without understanding Many are the torments of the wicked Be glad in the Lord and rejoice O righteous Rejoice in the Lord O you righteous. Praise the Lord with the lyre Sing to him a new song For the word of the Lord is upright He loves righteousness and justice By the word of the Lord the heavens were made He gathered the waters of the sea as in a bottle Let all the earth fear the Lord For he spoke and it came to be the Lord brings the counsel of the nations to nothing the counsel of the Lord stands forever Happy is the nation whose God is the Lord the Lord looks down from heaven From where he sits enthroned he watches he who fashions the hearts of them all A king is not saved by his great army the war horse is a vain hope for victory truly the eye of the Lord is on those who fear him to deliver their soul from death Our soul waits for the Lord Our heart is glad in him Let your steadfast love O Lord be upon us I will bless the Lord at all times My soul makes its boast in the Lord O magnify the Lord with me I sought the Lord and he answered me Look to him and be radiant this poor soul cried and was heard by the Lord the angel of the Lord encamps O taste and see that the Lord is good O fear the Lord you his holy ones the young lions suffer want and hunger Come O children listen to me Which of you desires life Keep your tongue from evil Depart from evil and do good the eyes of the Lord are on the righteous the face of the Lord is against evildoers When the righteous cry for help the Lord hears the Lord is near to the brokenhearted Many are the afflictions of the righteous He keeps all their bones Evil brings death to the wicked the Lord redeems the life of his servants Contend O Lord with those who contend with me take hold of shield and buckler Draw the spear and javelin Let them be put to shame and dishonor Let them be like chaff before the wind Let their way be dark and slippery For without cause they hid their net for me Let ruin come on them unawares. then my soul shall rejoice in the Lord All my bones shall say Malicious witnesses rise up they repay me evil for good But as for me when they were sick as though I grieved for a friend or a brother But at my stumbling they gathered in glee they impiously mocked more and more How long O Lord will you look on? then I will thank you in the great congregation Do not let my treacherous enemies rejoice over me For they do not speak peace they open wide their mouths against me You have seen O Lord do not be silent! Wake up! Bestir yourself for my defense Vindicate me O Lord my God Do not let them say to themselves Let all those who rejoice at my calamity Let those who desire my vindication then my tongue shall tell of your righteousness transgression speaks to the wicked For they flatter themselves in their own eyes the words of their mouths are mischief and deceit they plot mischief while on their beds Your steadfast love O Lord extends to the heavens Your righteousness is like the mighty mountains How precious is your steadfast love O God! they feast on the abundance of your house For with you is the fountain of life O continue your steadfast love to those who know you Do not let the foot of the arrogant tread on me there the evildoers lie prostrate Do not fret because of the wicked for they will soon fade like the grass trust in the Lord and do good take delight in the Lord Commit your way to the Lord He will make your vindication shine like the light Be still before the Lord and wait patiently for him Refrain from anger and forsake wrath.

Such are the wicked All in vain I have kept my heart clean For all day long I have been plagued If I had said “I will talk on in this way” But when I thought how to understand this until I went into the sanctuary of God truly you set them in slippery places How they are destroyed in a moment they are like a dream when one awakes When my soul was embittered I was stupid and ignorant Nevertheless I am continually with you You guide me with your counsel Whom have I in heaven but you? My flesh and my heart may fail Indeed those who are far from you will perish But for me it is good to be near God O God why do you cast us off forever? Remember your congregation which you acquired long ago Direct your steps to the perpetual ruins Your foes have roared within your holy place At the upper entrance they hacked And then with hatchets and hammers they set your sanctuary on fire they said to themselves “We will utterly subdue them” We do not see our emblems How long O God is the foe to scoff? Why do you hold back your hand Yet God my King is from of old You divided the sea by your might You crushed the heads of Leviathan You cut openings for springs and torrents Yours is the day yours also the night You have fixed all the bounds of the earth Remember this O Lord how the enemy scoffs Do not deliver the soul of your dove to the wild animals Have regard for your covenant Do not let the downtrodden be put to shame Rise up O God plead your cause Do not forget the clamor of your foes We give thanks to you O God At the set time that I appoint When the earth totters with all its inhabitants I say to the boastful “Do not boast” do not lift up your horn on high For not from the east or from the west but it is God who executes judgment For in the hand of the Lord there is a cup But I will rejoice forever All the horns of the wicked I will cut off In Judah God is known His abode has been established in Salem there he broke the flashing arrows Glorious are you more majestic the stouthearted were stripped of their spoil At your rebuke O God of Jacob But you indeed are awesome! From the heavens you uttered judgment when God rose up to establish judgment Human wrath serves only to praise you Make vows to the Lord your God and perform them who cuts off the spirit of princes I cry aloud to God In the day of my trouble I seek the Lord I think of God and I moan You keep my eyelids from closing I consider the days of old I commune with my heart in the night “Will the Lord spurn forever Has his steadfast love ceased forever? Has God forgotten to be gracious? And I say “It is my grief I will call to mind the deeds of the Lord I will meditate on all your work Your way O God is holy. You are the God who works wonders With your strong arm you redeemed your people When the waters saw you O God the clouds poured out water the crash of your thunder was in the whirlwind Your way was through the sea You led your people like a flock Give ear O my people to my teaching I will open my mouth in a parable things that we have heard and known We will not hide them from their children He established a decree in Jacob that the next generation might know them so that they should set their hope in God and that they should not be like their ancestors the Ephraimites armed with the bow they did not keep God’s covenant they forgot what he had done In the sight of their ancestors he worked marvels He divided the sea and let them pass through it In the daytime he led them with a cloud He split rocks open in the wilderness He made streams come out of the rock Yet they sinned still more against him they tested God in their heart they spoke against God saying Even though he struck the rock so that water gushed out therefore when the Lord heard he was full of rage because they had no faith in God Yet he commanded the skies above he rained down on them manna to eat Mortals ate of the bread of angels He caused the east wind to blow in the heavens he rained flesh upon them like dust he let them fall within their camp And they ate and were well filled But before they had satisfied their craving the anger of God rose against them In spite of all this they still sinned So he made their days vanish like a breath When he killed them they sought for him they remembered that God was their rock But they flattered him with their mouths their heart was not steadfast toward him Yet he being compassionate He remembered that they were but flesh How often they rebelled against him in the wilderness they tested God again and again they did not keep in mind his power when he displayed his signs in Egypt He turned their rivers to blood He sent among them swarms of flies which devoured them He gave their crops to the caterpillar He destroyed their vines with hail He gave over their cattle to the hail He let loose on them his fierce anger He made a path for his anger He struck all the firstborn in Egypt then he led out his people like sheep He led them in safety so that they were not afraid And he brought them to his holy hill He drove out nations before them Yet they tested the Most High God but turned away and were faithless like their ancestors For they provoked him to anger with their high places When God heard he was full of wrath He abandoned his dwelling at Shiloh and delivered his power to captivity He gave his people to the sword Fire devoured their young men their priests fell by the sword then the Lord awoke as from sleep He put his adversaries to rout He rejected the tent of Joseph but he chose the tribe of Judah He built his sanctuary like the high heavens He chose his servant David from tending the nursing ewes he brought him With upright heart he tended them O God the nations have come into your inheritance they have given the bodies of your servants they have poured out their blood like water We have become a taunt to our neighbors How long O Lord? Will you be angry forever? Pour out your anger on the nations For they have devoured Jacob Do not remember against us the iniquities of our ancestors Help us O God of our salvation Why should the nations say Let the groans of the prisoners come before you Return sevenfold into the bosom of our neighbors then we your people the flock of your pasture Give ear O Shepherd of Israel before Ephraim and Benjamin and Manasseh.

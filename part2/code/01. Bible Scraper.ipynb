I stand in the presence of God, and I have been sent to speak to you and to bring you this good news.', 'But now, because you did not believe my words, which will be fulfilled in their time, you will become mute, unable to speak, until the day these things occur.”', 'When he did come out, he could not speak to them, and they realized that he had seen a vision in the sanctuary. He kept motioning to them and remained unable to speak.', 'In the sixth month the angel Gabriel was sent by God to a town in Galilee called Nazareth,', 'to a virgin engaged to a man whose name was Joseph, of the house of David. The virgin’s name was Mary.', 'And he came to her and said, “Greetings, favored one! The Lord is with you.”[b]', 'The angel said to her, “Do not be afraid, Mary, for you have found favor with God.', 'He will be great, and will be called the Son of the Most High, and the Lord God will give to him the throne of his ancestor David.', 'The angel said to her, “The Holy Spirit will come upon you, and the power of the Most High will overshadow you; therefore the child to be born[d] will be holy; he will be called Son of God.', 'where she entered the house of Zechariah and greeted Elizabeth.', 'When Elizabeth heard Mary’s greeting, the child leaped in her womb.

Be made clean.” Immediately the leprosy[d] left him.', 'But he would withdraw to deserted places and pray.', 'When he saw their faith, he said, “Friend,[i] your sins are forgiven you.”', 'Then the scribes and the Pharisees began to question, “Who is this who is speaking blasphemies? Who can forgive sins but God alone?”', 'When Jesus perceived their questionings, he answered them, “Why do you raise such questions in your hearts?', 'Which is easier, to say, ‘Your sins are forgiven you,’ or to say, ‘Stand up and walk’?', 'But so that you may know that the Son of Man has authority on earth to forgive sins”—he said to the one who was paralyzed—“I say to you, stand up and take your bed and go to your home.”', 'Immediately he stood up before them, took what he had been lying on, and went to his home, glorifying God.', 'Amazement seized all of them, and they glorified God and were filled with awe, saying, “We have seen strange things today.”', 'Then Levi gave a great banquet for him in his house; and there was a large crowd of tax collectors and others sitting at the table[j] with them.', 'Then they said to him, “John’s disciples, like the disciples of the Pharisees, frequently fast and pray, but your disciples eat and drink.”', 'But new wine must be put into fresh wineskins.', 'He entered the house of God and took and ate the bread of the Presence, which it is not lawful for any but the priests to eat, and gave some to his companions?”', 'On another sabbath he entered the synagogue and taught, and there was a man there whose right hand was withered.', 'Even though he knew what they were thinking, he said to the man who had the withered hand, “Come and stand here.” He got up and stood there.', 'After looking around at all of them, he said to him, “Stretch out your hand.” He did so, and his hand was restored.', 'Now during those days he went out to the mountain to pray; and he spent the night in prayer to God.', 'He came down with them and stood on a level place, with a great crowd of his disciples and a great multitude of people from all Judea, Jerusalem, and the coast of Tyre and Sidon.', 'Rejoice in that day and leap for joy, for surely your reward is great in heaven; for that is what their ancestors did to the prophets.', '“But woe to you who are rich,', '“Woe to you when all speak well of you, for that is what their ancestors did to the false prophets.', '“But I say to you that listen, Love your enemies, do good to those who hate you,', '“If you love those who love you, what credit is that to you?

Because you have been trustworthy in a very small thing, take charge of ten cities.’', 'As he was now approaching the path down from the Mount of Olives, the whole multitude of the disciples began to praise God joyfully with a loud voice for all the deeds of power that they had seen,', 'saying, “If you, even you, had only recognized on this day the things that make for peace! But now they are hidden from your eyes.', 'One day, as he was teaching the people in the temple and telling the good news, the chief priests and the scribes came with the elders', 'and said to him, “Tell us, by what authority are you doing these things?
